          <p class="text-center"> Now, I realize that pleated skirts can seem intimidating to wear, as well as a little too preppy, professional, and maybe even old-fashioned. I get it! Knife pleats (the tiny, sharp pleats you usually see on midi skirts) are also difficult to take care of and have a very *~*high fashion*~* quality to them. Even larger pleats can seem difficult to wear because they can easily look very dressed up or mature… and that’s not always the look you’re going for.

The thing is, though, there are actually tons of ways to wear pleated skirts, and most of these are really fun and cool outfit ideas instead of something that will remind you of your grandma. Don’t believe me?.</p><br>
