          <p class="text-center"> Every year my mom asks for the same Christmas gift, THIS CANDLE.  The scent always reminds me of home because she has had her signature scent burning in every room of the house since I was in grade school :) When I moved into this house I started burning THIS CANDLE and it is become my signature scent, but I love to switch it up during the holidays with THIS ONE and THIS ONE. I know it is early to start talking about holiday gifts, but THESE SETS make the best gifts for your girlfriends or gift exchanges.</p><br>
